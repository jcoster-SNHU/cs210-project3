# cs210-project3

#The purpose of this project was to build a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.

#This project wasn't too challenging for myself, as I have build similar applications before, however I do struggle with formatting the user inputs on the second steps correctly to present the user with the correct choices, this took some careful debugging and practice with loops. I think I could definitely slim down my code and make it more streamlined, also work on some of my comments and documentation throughout the build. I tend to forget about these notes until the end of my development. I think in a practical sense, working with user inputs like this is a key crucial step to building real world programs for tons of different applications. Taking user inputs and sending that data to the correct spot is a daily coding activity for me in the work place. I made this code functional and readable by using industry best practices and formatting, and trying to write code that was consise and ran without issues after debugging.
